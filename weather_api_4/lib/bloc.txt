Bloc separates UI, state and business logic clearly and 
makes apps highly scalable.

Why bloc?
    1. Handles complex state transitions
    2. Predictable state changes
    3. Event -> Logic -> state
    4. Works great for medium/large apps
    5. Great for testing

Core concepts in Bloc
 
 Event -> Something that happens (user clicks, API call)
 state -> The current UI status (loading, success, error)
 Bloc -> Receives events, runs logic, emits states
 UI -> Listens to state changes and rebuilds
